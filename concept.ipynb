    "- Rania uses a music streaming application that recommends songs. Every time she listens to, likes or skips a song, the application records these actions. Over time, the application's machine learning algorithm learns her musical preferences. One day, she discovers a new song that she loves, recommended by the application. Using machine learning, the app analysed her habits and suggested this song, making Marie's experience more personalised and enjoyable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, in the field of insurance, Marc, who owns a car, uses a car insurance policy that adjusts her monthly premiums according to her driving habits. Thanks to a device connected to her car, the insurer collects data on her driving: speed, sudden braking, etc. The machine learning algorithm analyses this data and adjusts her premiums according to her driving habits. The machine learning algorithm analyses this data and adjusts Marie's premiums. By driving carefully, Marie's premiums are lower, and she benefits from fairer, more personalised insurance.\n"

    "A model is a simplified representation of a reality or system, used to understand, analyse or predict its behaviour.\n",
    "the model is trained using training data to learn the relationships between the variables. It is then tested on a different set of data to adjust its parameters and, once trained, it can use new data to make predictions or classifications based on what it has learned.\n",

    "* We distinguish several categories of model, such as regression models (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression), classification models (e.g. decision trees, SVMs, neural networks), clustering models (e.g. K-means, DBSCAN), time series models (e.g. ARIMA, LSTM), dimensionality reduction models (e.g. PCA, t-SNE), ensemble models (e.g. random forests, boosting), and so on.\n",
